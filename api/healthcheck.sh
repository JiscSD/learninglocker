# LearningPool API health-check.

# LearningLocker is developed to stay always up, even after the application has fallen into an unknown state and needs restarting.
# For example, try restarting the Mongo database, LearningPool API should report UNHEALTHY.

# HEALTHY: Provide a non authorised credential and expect the application to return a 401 (unauthorised) status code.
# UNHEALTHY: If the application is in a broken state, it will return a 500 (internal server error) status code.
